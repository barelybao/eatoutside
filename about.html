    <h1>Why Gentle Hawker?</h1>
    
    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>Eating in Singapore is a national pastime, but it can often feel like a source of stress or "health guilt." Gentle Hawker was created to help you navigate our beautiful food centers with more ease and less anxiety.</p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We believe in <strong>harm reduction</strong>, not restriction. You don't need to stop eating the foods you love to feel better. We don't use calorie counts or clinical language. Instead, we offer simple adjustments that make your favorite meals feel a little lighter on the palate.</p>

    <h2>How to Use This</h2>
    <p>Think of this as a gentle friend sitting across the table. Pick your dish and see the options. Whether you choose a Gentle, Moderate, or Heavier version depends entirely on how you feel today—there are no wrong answers.</p>
